Jelly Habits — Privacy Policy

Effective date: June 1, 2025

Thank you for using Jelly Habits. Your privacy matters. This Privacy Policy explains what (if any) personal data the Jelly Habits mobile app collects, how it’s used, and your rights. Short version: Jelly Habits does not collect, store, or share any personal data from users.

1. Data collection — the short answer

Jelly Habits does not collect any personal data. That means:

No name, email, phone number, address, or other identifiers.

No usage analytics, crash reports, or event logs that are sent to third parties.

No location, contacts, photos, camera, microphone, calendar, or health data are accessed or stored.

No advertising identifiers or any tracking is used.

If you see any prompt requesting access to device features (camera, photos, notifications, etc.), Jelly Habits will not request them. If you encounter a permissions request, please contact us immediately (see “Contact” below).

2. App Store / App Submission summary 

For the App Store listing and privacy labels, you can use the following concise statements:

Data collected: None.

Data linked to you: None.

Data used to track you: None.

Third-party data collection: None.

Third-party analytics / SDKs: None.

You can paste this short summary into App Store Connect’s “Privacy” section and set the privacy labels to “No Data Collected”.

3. Third parties & SDKs

Jelly Habits does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, SDKs, or services that collect data. The app is self-contained and operates entirely on the device without sending data to servers.

If we decide in the future to add third-party services (for analytics, crash reporting, or ads), we will:

Update this Privacy Policy and the App Store privacy labels before releasing the update.

Provide clear notice to users and, where required, obtain consent.

4. Data retention and storage

Because Jelly Habits does not collect or transmit user data to external servers, there is nothing retained on our servers. Any information you enter inside the app (if any local note or setting exists) is stored locally on your device only, and never leaves your device.

If you delete the app, any locally stored app data is removed according to your device’s normal app-removal behavior.

5. Children’s privacy

Jelly Habits does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (or the applicable age in your country). Since the app collects no personal data, it is suitable for general audiences. If you are a parent and believe your child’s device contains information from the app, you may delete the app to remove locally stored content.

6. Security

Because no data is transmitted from the device to our servers, the primary security considerations are local device security (passcode, device encryption, etc.). We recommend keeping your device OS up to date and using the device’s built-in security features.

7. User rights and requests

Because Jelly Habits does not collect personal data, there is no personal data to access, correct, or delete. If you nevertheless wish to:

Request confirmation that Jelly Habits does not collect information, or

Report a bug, suspicious permission prompt, or unexpected network activity,

please contact us at the address below. We will respond and investigate promptly.

8. Changes to this policy

If the app’s data practices change in the future (for example, we add cloud sync, analytics, or social features), we will:

Update this Privacy Policy with the new practices and effective date.

Update the App Store privacy labels to accurately reflect the new data collection.

Notify users of important changes in-app (where applicable) before collecting any new data.

9. Contact
